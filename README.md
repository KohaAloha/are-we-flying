# Is Pomax Flying?

This may not be an important question to most, but it's an important question to me. Pomax. And possibly one or two other people who also "play" MSFS, but that's good enough for me: let's write some code that can tell whether or not you're flying in MSFS and if so, show where you're flying, and what your general orientation and flight vectors are.

### you checked in an entire `venv`?

Yep. No need to `pip install` for you.

### but you didn't check in a `node_modules`?

Oh, no, I checked totally checked that in too. It's in the `website` dir. No need to `npm install` for you either.

### ... and a... `run.bat`? Really?

Yeah, shocker, the majority of the world is on Windows, despite it still being the year of Linux on the desktop. Who knew?

### Okay look we need to talk

Super, hit me up on https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax or https://mastodon.social/@therealpomax, or if you're _actually_ serious, open an issue and we can actually talk in a way that has a permanent, public record and all that. Because if you're truly serious, the world should be our audience.
